The project is an assignment in the 'Getting And Cleaning Data' course.

The folder of this project contains [1] A tidy data file; [2] a CodeBook (CodeBook.md) file that describes the variables, data and the cleaning process. [3] An R script (run_analysis.R) that loads the data and performs the cleanup/formatting. [4] This README.md file.
